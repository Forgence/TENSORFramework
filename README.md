# TENSOR Framework

### Threat Evaluation and Neutralization through Structured Organizational Resilience

The TENSOR Framework is a cutting-edge, modular approach to Security Operations Center (SOC) design and implementation. It represents a shift away from traditional linear incident response models to a dynamic, interconnected system capable of adapting to evolving threats with efficiency and precision. 

The acronym **TENSOR** stands for **Threat Evaluation and Neutralization through Structured Organizational Resilience**, emphasizing the framework's core focus on evaluating threats, neutralizing them, and building resilience within an organization's security posture.

## Overview

Modern cyber threats are highly complex, involving multiple attack vectors and evolving rapidly. Traditional, static SOC playbooks are often unable to keep up with these dynamic threats. The TENSOR Framework addresses this challenge by providing a modular, adaptive system that allows SOCs to flexibly respond to incidents using interconnected response modules.

The framework is designed around five core categories, each consisting of specialized modules and submodules that allow for efficient detection, analysis, containment, and recovery of security incidents. These categories are built with a focus on dynamic interaction, allowing multiple categories to be engaged simultaneously as an incident evolves, thus reducing response times and ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Core Categories

1. **Devices and Systems Activity**: Monitors endpoints, servers, IoT, and OT systems for suspicious activities. It includes modules for Application Monitoring, Device Configuration, Endpoint Isolation, IoT/OT Monitoring, and Process Analysis.

2. **File and Data Activity**: Manages file integrity, analyzes potential malware, and monitors sensitive data movement. This category includes modules such as Data Movement Tracking, File Integrity Check, Malware Analysis, and Sensitive Data Monitoring.

3. **Network Activity**: Monitors and protects the network from malicious activities, focusing on detecting anomalous traffic, command and control communications, and lateral movement. Modules include Lateral Movement Tracking, Malicious IP Detection, Protocol Anomaly Detection, Traffic Pattern Analysis, and URL and Domain Analysis.

4. **Suspicious Email Activity**: Focuses on detecting and analyzing email-based threats such as phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC), and malicious attachments or links. Modules include Header Analysis, Threat Detection, and User Interaction Monitoring.

5. **User and Access Activity**: Monitors user behavior and access patterns to detect compromised accounts and insider threats. Modules include Behavioral Baseline Comparison, Insider Threat Detection, Login Anomaly Detection, and Privilege Escalation Monitoring.

## Key Features

### Modularity
The TENSOR Framework is built on modular components that interact dynamically. Each category is composed of specialized modules, which in turn consist of submodules addressing different aspects of SOC operations. This modular approach ensures that any changes or updates to a module do not disrupt the entire system, allowing for scalability and adaptability.

### Dynamic Phase Transitions
The framework supports dynamic phase transitions across the four traditional SOC phases: **Detection**, **Containment**, **Eradication**, and **Recovery**. Each category and module can operate independently across these phases, allowing for parallel efforts in different areas of an incident. This reduces overall response time and enhances the depth of analysis.

### Alignment with MITRE ATT&CK
The TENSOR Framework is fully aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all 14 tactics and 193 techniques. This alignment enables SOC analysts to understand the broader context of threats and effectively respond to them.

## Why Choose TENSOR?

- **Adaptability**: The modular nature of TENSOR allows it to respond to emerging threats without requiring a complete overhaul of the system.
- **Comprehensive Threat Coverage**: Aligned with MITRE ATT&CK, TENSOR ensures no major threat tactic or technique is left unaddressed.
- **Efficiency**: By allowing categories to interact dynamically, incidents are handled in parallel, reducing overall response time and providing a more in-depth analysis.
- **Scalability**: New modules can be integrated as the threat landscape evolves, ensuring the framework remains up-to-date.

## Real-World Use Case
Imagine a phishing email is detected by the **Suspicious Email Activity** category. This email contains a malicious link and an attachment. Using TENSOR, the email is flagged, and multiple actions occur simultaneously: 
- The **Header Analysis** module checks for anomalies in sender information.
- The **Malware Analysis** submodule in the **File and Data Activity** category investigates the attachment in a sandbox.
- The **Network Activity** category is invoked to assess the reputation of the link.
- **User Interaction Monitoring** records any employee actions related to the email.

As each module completes its task, the findings are shared across categories, creating a complete incident profile and allowing for fast containment and neutralization.

## How to Get Started
To implement TENSOR Framework within your SOC, start by identifying which of the core categories are most relevant to your current security environment. Then, adapt the modules to fit your unique threat landscape. The modular nature of TENSOR means you can implement components incrementally, scaling and adapting the framework as your capabilities grow.

## Contributing
The TENSOR Framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and contributions are welcomed to improve and expand its capabilities. If you wish to contribute or adapt the TENSOR Framework for your organization, reach out with your modifications, and letâ€™s work together to strengthen the resilience of SOCs everywhere.
